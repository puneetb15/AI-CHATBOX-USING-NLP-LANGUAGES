# AI Chatbot with NLP

This project is a simple AI chatbot built using Python and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) library, NLTK. The chatbot is designed to interact with users, answer their queries, and provide information based on predefined patterns and responses. It is a rule-based chatbot, meaning it responds to user input using a set of predefined rules and patterns.

---

## Features
1. Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot uses NLP techniques to process and understand user input.
2. Predefined Responses: It responds to user queries based on a set of predefined patterns and responses.
3. Interactive Chat: Users can interact with the chatbot in real-time by typing their questions.
4. Expandable: The chatbot can be easily extended by adding more patterns and responses to handle additional queries.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python: The programming language used to build the chatbot.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A Python library used for NLP tasks such as tokenization and pattern matching.
- Regular Expressions: Used to define patterns for matching user input.

---

## How It Works
The chatbot works by matching user input against a set of predefined patterns using regular expressions. When a match is found, it generates an appropriate response. If no match is found, it provides a default response.

### Key Components:
1. Patterns and Responses: The chatbot uses a list of patterns and corresponding responses to handle user queries.
2. NLTK Chat Utility: The `Chat` class from NLTK simplifies the process of matching patterns and generating responses.
3. User Interaction: The chatbot runs in a loop, allowing continuous interaction until the user types "quit", "bye", or "exit".

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-chatbot-nlp.git
   cd ai-chatbot-nlp
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   - Install the required Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install nltk
     ```

3. Download NLTK Data:
   - Run the following command to download the necessary NLTK data (only required for the first time):
     ```bash
     python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
     ```

4. Run the Chatbot:
   - Execute the chatbot script:
     ```bash
     python chatbot.py
     ```

---

## Usage
1. Start the chatbot by running the script.
2. Type your questions or queries in the terminal.
3. The chatbot will respond based on the predefined patterns.
4. Type "quit", "bye", or "exit" to end the conversation.

## Future Enhancements
1. Add More Patterns: Expand the chatbot's capabilities by adding more patterns and responses.
2. Integrate APIs: Connect the chatbot to external APIs (e.g., weather, news) to provide real-time information.
3. Use Machine Learning: Replace the rule-based approach with a machine learning model for more advanced conversational abilities.
4. Deploy the Chatbot: Use frameworks like Flask or Django to deploy the chatbot as a web application.
